# Sales-Data-Analysis-with-SQLite-Pandas-Matplotlib
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to store, retrieve, and analyze sales data using SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Python.
This project demonstrates how to create a simple sales summary analysis using Python with SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It starts by creating a SQLite database (sales_data.db) with sample transaction records for products like Coffee, Tea, and Sandwiches. Using SQL queries embedded in Python, it calculates total quantities sold and total revenue per product. The results are printed in a readable format using Pandas, and a revenue-based bar chart is generated using Matplotlib, which is also saved as an image. This mini-project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how to integrate databases with data analysis and visualization in Python.
